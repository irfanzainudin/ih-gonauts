# IOTA Payment Flow Implementation

## Overview

We've successfully implemented a complete IOTA payment flow that mirrors the Stripe payment experience, providing users with a seamless booking journey from payment to confirmation.

## Flow Comparison

### Stripe Flow (Existing)

1. **Space Detail Page** → **Stripe Payment Modal** → **Redirect to Stripe** → **Success Page** → **User Bookings**

### IOTA Flow (New)

1. **Space Detail Page** → **IOTA Payment Modal** → **Transaction Processing** → **Success Page** → **User Bookings**

## Key Components

### 1. IOTA Payment Modal (`frontend/src/components/shared/ui/iota-payment-modal.tsx`)

- **Payment Summary**: Shows booking details and IOTA amount
- **Loyalty Preview**: Displays tokens to be earned
- **Transaction Processing**: Simulates IOTA network transaction
- **Success State**: Shows transaction hash and confirmation
- **Auto-redirect**: Navigates to success page after completion

### 2. Updated Space Detail Page
