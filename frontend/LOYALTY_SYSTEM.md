# Loyalty System Implementation

## Overview

We've successfully implemented a comprehensive loyalty tracking dashboard for the IOTA Gonauts space booking platform. The system rewards users with IOTA tokens based on their booking frequency and provides tier-based benefits.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Loyalty Tiers

- **Bronze** (0 bookings): Starting tier
- **Silver** (3 bookings): 5 IOTA tokens per booking + 5% discount
- **Gold** (7 bookings): 15 IOTA tokens per booking + 10% discount
- **Platinum** (15 bookings): 30 IOTA tokens per booking + 15% discount
- **Diamond** (30 bookings): 50 IOTA tokens per booking + 20% discount

### 2. Loyalty Dashboard Components

#### Main Dashboard (`/wallet/bookings`)

- **Current Tier Display**: Shows user's current tier with progress to next tier
- **Token Statistics**: Available, total earned, and used tokens
- **Progress Bar**: Visual representation of progress to next tier
- **Tabbed Interface**: Overview, History, and Rewards tabs

#### Tab Features:

- **Overview Tab**: Displays all loyalty tiers with current status
- **History Tab**: Shows recent booking history with tokens earned
- **Rewards Tab**: Available rewards and redemption options

### 3. Integration Points

#### Space Detail Page

- Loyalty rewards display in booking summary
- Shows current tier benefits and tokens to be earned
- Automatic discount application

#### Wallet Bookings Page

- Complete loyalty dashboard integration
- Real-time progress tracking
- Token balance display
